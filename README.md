# RunBunRun
## Project Description:
Infinite runner mobile game in a 3D playspace. The player plays as a bunny in a forest that tries to collect carrots and feathers while avoiding being eaten by wolves. You need to collect a carrot before the green stamina wheel runs out or you will be slowed while a red stamina wheel fills up. If the red stamina wheel maxes out the player will die of starvation. If a player is caught by a wolf they are eaten. Those are the two ways a run can end. Collecting carrots and feathers will both increase the player's score. Feathers are a currency used to purchase upgrades in the game's shop menu, which include increasing the bunny's speed, turning rate, jump height, and stamina. All of the upgrades help the player increase their runtime in different ways, which can help to increase their score.

## Built By:
- Matt Lefurge
- Joseph Campanelli

## Notes:
Due to some unforseen omptimization issues and the nature of having a large number of gameobjects in the scene at the same time, we added fog to the edge of the player's view to help mask the loading/unloading of obstacles' meshes that we disable and re-enable using a distance based rendering system.

This project was playable on the Google Play Store at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.TeamBortt.RunBunRun, up until August 2019, when it was removed for not updating to adhere to the new 64-bit support requirement.
